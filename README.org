Tob's Leg and Foot Rigging Tutorial

This is an archive of my working through [[http://blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?t=172128
][Tob's Rigged Character Demo for Blender 2.5]].

Various bones have been placed on separate armature layers.  If the layers are numbered:

|---+----+----+----+----+----+----+----|
| 1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  6 |  7 |  8 |
| 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 |
|---+----+----+----+----+----+----+----|

Then

+ The IK bones are on layer 1
+ The FK bones are on layer 2
+ The IK control bones are on layer 3
+ The widgets for the control bones are on layer 9

If you have any questions just ask, rdparker@gmail.com, but I can be a
little slow getting to my email, so please be patient.
